You are an expert full-stack product engineer inside Cursor, specializing in UX improvements, functional flows, and high-trust user interactions.

Your task:
Improve the UI/UX, workflows, validations, restriction logic, and safety rules for this MVP peer-to-peer parcel delivery platform.

This requires changes to:

UI screens

User journeys

Data validation

Permissions logic

State transitions

Policies + onboarding UX

Task lifecycle

Task restrictions

Rider limitations

🔥 CORE ISSUES TO FIX
SIGNUP ISSUES

Fix signup flow:

User must view Policies & Usage Rules

Add Agree checkbox before account creation

Redirect to onboarding profile setup:

Name

Profile image upload

Short bio

OPTIONAL: PayNow QR upload (can be edited later)

TASK CREATION ISSUES

Fix flow:

Allow upload of item photo

Add category selection

Ban restricted categories (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, food)

Show SG compliance warning

Tasks auto-expire if not accepted in 60 minutes

RIDER FLOW ISSUES

Fix immediately:

Rider dashboard must show accepted/pending tasks

Rider must be able to track status

Rider cannot accept next task until:

OTP verified for current pickup

AND must be holding < 3 active pickups max

DISTANCE / SORTING

Implement:

Filter tasks by proximity

Default radius: 1 km

Tasks sorted by nearest first

OTP FLOW FIX

Flow must be:

Sender gives OTP

Rider verifies OTP

System transitions to "picked up" only after verification

Then allow new task pickup eligibility

ROUTE ACTION UX

When clicking pickup or dropoff → open external maps app (Google Maps / Apple Maps)

Not internal maps

parcel journey timeline UI

statuses:

Created

Accepted

Waiting Pickup

PLATFORM POSITIONING MANDATORY IN UX

Display clearly:

Peer-to-peer marketplace model

Not a logistics company

No illegal items

for privacy reasons

REQUIRED NEW SCREENS

Must create/update:
