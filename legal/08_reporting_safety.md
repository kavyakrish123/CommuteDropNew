- Items that violate Singapore law
- Controlled substances or illegal goods
- Counterfeit or stolen items
- Any items that are clearly illegal

### 3. Abusive User
- Users who engage in harassment or abuse
- Users who make threats or use inappropriate language
- Users who engage in discriminatory behavior
- Users who violate community standards

### 4. Inappropriate Behavior
- Behavior that violates Platform rules

## Report Handling

- Platform administrators are notified in real-time

### Review Process
- Reports are reviewed within [specified timeframe]

### Outcomes
Possible outcomes of reporting:

- User information is protected in accordance with the Privacy Policy

### Retaliation Protection
- Users who report violations are protected from retaliation
- Retaliatory behavior is itself a reportable offense

## Emergency Situations

For **immediate safety threats** or **illegal activity**:

- ✅ Abusive or threatening behavior
- ✅ Suspicious or unsafe items

Users should NOT report:
- ❌ Minor disagreements
- ✅ Payment disputes (resolve directly with users)
- ✅ Delivery delays (unless involving fraud)
- ✅ Personal conflicts unrelated to Platform safety

## Acknowledgment

By using the reporting function, you acknowledge that:
- You are reporting genuine violations
- False reports may result in account suspension
- Reports are reviewed by administrators
- Appropriate action will be taken based on Platform rules
